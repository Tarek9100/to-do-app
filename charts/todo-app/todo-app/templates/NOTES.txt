Get the To-Do app running in a browser by opening up port 3000, by default.

For instance, run the following command and get the EXTERNAL-IP listed:

  $ kubectl get svc

If you are running the app in minikube, you first need to open up another 
terminal and run the following as a non-root user with sudo access:

  $ minikube tunnel  # Please wait to type in your password.
